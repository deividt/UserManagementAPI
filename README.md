## User Management API

This api is a user management api, part of the backend of the Microsoft Backend Training.

### Prompt used to generate the API endpoints

```
In my UsersController, add the endpoints for the following operations:

    GET: Retrieve a list of users or a specific user by ID.

    POST: Add a new user.

    PUT: Update an existing user's details.

    DELETE: Remove a user by ID.


Also create a User object to represent our user, that should have id, name and e-mail as properties.

Use the best practices and use a static list to store the users.

```

### Prompts used to help idenfity errors and improve code quality

```
Can you see if there is any errors on Users were being added without proper validation and fix them?
```

```
Great, what about Errors occurred when retrieving non-existent users?
```

```
Is there anything that can be done in order to improve the GetUsers endpoint?
